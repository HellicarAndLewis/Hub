Information about the Twitter parts of WaillWall
================================================

You can find all the code related to twitter in:

# apps/wail/SharedCode/*
# addons/roxlu/*

The important thing you need to know when using the WailWall application, is
that you need to authorize on it twitter. What does this mean? Well, the twitter
application will create status updates. In order to create these status updates
it needs to "login" as a existing twitter user so to say.  To login, it uses 
oauth, which is basically a way for a twitter user to allow an application to 
do (automated) status updates for you. 

Also when you connect to a user stream, you'll get the stream from the user
who authorized the application. 

So in order to authorize the application you need to follow these steps below.
Once you've done these steps a there will be a file called "twitter.txt" in the
data folder which contains a token key and token secret which are used to 
create "signature" (this is just how oauth works). But these are necessary!
The token key and secret are only for the user who authorized the application!

IMPORTANT
----------

When you remove the twitter.txt file you can re-authorize the application again.
If you do something wrong, or you get disconnected for a certain reason remember
that Twitter has a fair use policy and you should be "nice" for the servers,
so do not restart the application too many times when you can't connect; make
sure to contact the developer to check what's wrong.


AUTHORIZING A THE APPLICATION USIN A TWITTER ACCOUNT
-----------------------------------------------------

These steps describe how you can authorize your application using a twitter
account. For this  we're allowing the application to perform status updates 
for the user @dewarshub twitter account.

Note: YOU ONLY NEED TO DO THIS ONCE!

- remove the bin/data/twitter.txt file
- start the application from xcode and make sure you see the console
- a browser will automatically open asking you to authorize the app
- make sure you're logged in a @dewarshub (if not you can relogin and twitter
will send you back to this same page)
- click the authorize button
- enter the pin you see there in the console of xode, right after the colon ":"
- then, after entering the pin, press enter

Now the WailWall application is authorized and can do posts for the @dewarshub
user. 


BAD WORD FILTERING
-------------------

The bin/data/badwords.txt file contains a list with words that is used to 
filter out tweets. The file was downloaded form: 
http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/2008/04/04/bad-words-list/ and we replace all
"*", ";" and "+" signs from the list as we're using regexps to match any 
of these characters. To "yoyodilo" will be filtered out.


HASHTAGS
--------

When the application starts it loads all hashtags from 
bin/data/twitter_hashtags.txt. Make sure to -not- use the # sign as it's not 
necessary and the connection will break on it. All tweets that contain a 
word from this file will be retrieved (please read the twitter streaming 
information on dev.twitter.com on the specifics of the streaming server).


CODE FLOW
---------

TwitterApp: 	
	
	big proxy between all other stuff.. this is what you is 
	interfaced against int the rest of the application.


TwitterEventListener:

	Using a Twitter and Stream object we connect to the twitter server. When
	a new tweet is received form the stream, this class is called. This class
	call the DB which insert the tweet after checking for bad words.
	

TwitterThreadedImageWriter:

	People on twitter can send a tweet like: "@dewarshub [search term]". when
	we receive this search term it's add to a search term queue which is
	handled in the ofxWWTweetParticleManager. When there is no physical 
	interaction with the plinth, the application switches to a mode where it
	checks the queue with search terms. When there is a new search term it
	highlights these in the visualization. Once a new search term is being
	activated we copy the pixels to this image writer class. This class writes
	the pixels to an image and adds it to the twitter-send-queue database.
	
	
TwitterPhotoUploader:

	Once a screenshot has been taken and stored on disk the TwitterThreadedImageWriter
	adds a new entry to the send_queue table. In TwitterPhotoUploader we 
	poll this table and check if there are images which we need to send back
	to the user who posted the search term. When we find one AND we did not
	exceet the rate limit of twitter we will post a tweet (using the currently
	connected twitter user; i.e. the one who granted access)

	
TwitterOSCReceiver:

	The OSC receiver receives events form the admin website. The website
	runs on localhost and sends OSC events. These events i.e. update the 
	list with bad words, the works to track etc..
	
	
TwitterMySQL:

	Used to retrieve badwords and hashtags which are maintained with the 
	website. This is just querying the MySQL database which runs on localhost
