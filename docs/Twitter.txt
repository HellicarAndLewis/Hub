Information about the Twitter parts of WaillWall
================================================

You can find all the code related to twitter in:

# apps/wail/SharedCode/*
# addons/roxlu/*

The important thing you need to know when using the WailWall application, is
that you need to authorize on it twitter. What does this mean? Well, the twitter
application will create status updates. In order to create these status updates
it needs to "login" as a existing twitter user so to say.  To login, it uses 
oauth, which is basically a way for a twitter user to allow an application to 
do (automated) status updates for you. 

Also when you connect to a user stream, you'll get the stream from the user
who authorized the application. 

So in order to authorize the application you need to follow these steps below.
Once you've done these steps a there will be a file called "twitter.txt" in the
data folder which contains a token key and token secret which are used to 
create "signature" (this is just how oauth works). But these are necessary!
The token key and secret are only for the user who authorized the application!

IMPORTANT
----------
When you remove the twitter.txt file you can re-authorize the application again.
If you do something wrong, or you get disconnected for a certain reason remember
that Twitter has a fair use policy and you should be "nice" for the servers,
so do not restart the application too many times when you can't connect; make
sure to contact the developer to check what's wrong.


AUTHORIZING A THE APPLICATION USIN A TWITTER ACCOUNT
-----------------------------------------------------
These steps describe how you can authorize your application using a twitter
account. For this  we're allowing the application to perform status updates 
for the user @dewarshub twitter account.

Note: YOU ONLY NEED TO DO THIS ONCE!

- remove the bin/data/twitter.txt file
- start the application from xcode and make sure you see the console
- a browser will automatically open asking you to authorize the app
- make sure you're logged in a @dewarshub (if not you can relogin and twitter
will send you back to this same page)
- click the authorize button
- enter the pin you see there in the console of xode, right after the colon ":"
- then, after entering the pin, press enter

Now the WailWall application is authorized and can do posts for the @dewarshub
user.
